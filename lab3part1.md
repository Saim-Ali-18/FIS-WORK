## The limits of trust-free systems: A literature review on blockchain technology and trust in the sharing economy

1.At the tip of the hype cycle, trust-free systems based on blockchain technology promise to revolutionize interactions between peers that require high degrees of trust, usually facilitated by third party providers. Peer-to-peer platforms for resource sharing represent a frequently discussed field of application for “trust-free” blockchain technology. However, trust between peers plays a crucial and complex role in virtually all sharing economy interactions. In this article, we hence shed light on how these conflicting notions may be resolved and explore the potential of blockchain technology for dissolving the issue of trust in the sharing economy.

2.Blockchain, Sharing economy, Trust, Trust-free system, Literature review

3.Before the backdrop of our research question, how “trust-free” systems based on blockchain technology may impact the notion and formation of trust in the sharing economy, our review has demonstrated that the concepts of trust for the sharing economy and for blockchain technology differ substantially and that there exists an obvious tension. On the one hand, trust in the sharing economy is widely regarded as a complex concept with multiple stakeholders, targets, and dimensions (Hawlitschek et al., 2016a, Hawlitschek et al., 2016c Mittendorf, 2016, Möhlmann, 2016, Tussyadiah, 2016, Tussyadiah, 2015, Yang et al., 2016). On the other hand, the promise of the blockchain as a trust-free technology points at the replacement of trusted third parties such as platform intermediaries.

## Cyber physical ecommerce logistics system: An implementation case in Hong Kong

1.Space limitation confines cross-border ecommerce logistics development in Hong Kong. Information technologies and practices lagged types are still used in most of small and medium sized enterprises. In order to upgrade the ecommerce logistics by making full use the cutting-edge technologies and principle. In physical world, industrial wearable technology transforms traditional assets into cloud assets. In cyber world, synchronization mechanisms improve the utilization ratio of spaces and resources while reducing waiting and wastage.It shows that this platform can realize modularization of technology application with sufficient productivity improvement and bring about step-change paradigm for ecommerce logistics.

2.Ecommerce logistics, Cyber physical system, Synchronization, Case studies

3.This paper presents a CPS-enabled platform solution for addressing pain-spot issues in (virtual) ecommerce logistics chains. Problems in the traditional ecommerce logistics parks in both Hong Kong and mainland China have been identified. An innovative multi-layer cloud system architecture has been established to sense, process and manage real-time events in the complicated ecommerce logistics scenarios. Core technological innovations, as main components of CPeLS platform, have been examined with design and implementation considerations. Case studies from Hong Kong SMEs are used to demonstrate the necessity and usefulness of presented systems and mechanisms.
